VRChat Avatar Remote

This repository is used for tracking feature requests, improvements, bugs, and general discussion for a VRCOSC-Remote.

This app lets you change avatars parameters through a browser-based interface
Toggles, buttons and Float wheels
Sort of like a customizable extension of the Action Menu but on online for everyone

### Closed alpha
Currently only myself and 1 additional user for testing reasons have access.
Later during this year I'm looking to expand this for more users but theres lots of nieche things to work on.
This is my solo project and theres lots of problems to manage after more then 2 users appear.

Want access?
